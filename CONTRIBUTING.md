# Contributing to Concise

Welcome to the Concise! We are not only here to make it as simple as possible to build websites but also to contribute to the project. 

By following this guide to contributing, we can make sure that everything is up-to-code (pun intended), everything is formatted properly, and we are posting bug reports, feature requests and questions in the proper area.

Sound good? **Let's move on...**

# Bug reports, feature requests and questions

In lieu of a mailing list, we are going to manage all specific questions through [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). This way we can leverage the entire community for help, and also not worry about wading through loads of spam.

Members of the Concise team are subscribed to specific tags via [Stack Exchange Filters](http://stackexchange.com/filters) so that if a question is properly tagged, we can respond in a timely manner and help. 

**Which tags?**

Ideally we would like to keep it to just one tag for Concise questions, but we are subscribed to multiple varients to make sure nothing passes by us. However, for everybody asking a question, please use: 

- [Concise](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/concise)

**Where do I post this?**
