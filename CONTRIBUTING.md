# Contributing to Concise

Welcome to the Concise! We are not only here to make it as simple as possible to build websites but also to contribute to the project. 

By following this guide to contributing, we can make sure that everything is up-to-code (pun intended), everything is formatted properly, and we are posting bug reports, feature requests and questions in the proper area.

Sound good? **Let's move on...**
